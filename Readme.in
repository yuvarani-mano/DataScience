Dear All,
I'm Yuvarani Manoaharan. I have 14 years of IT experience in Data data warehousing, Business Intelligence and Bigdata Analytics. I rather than data science role I could say I involved in data analytics.
My experience as below,
1.    Analysis of banking fraudulent data and created dynamic visualisation in live data
2.    Worked on customer details and customer survey , to understand the confident of customer satisfaction and unsatisfactory area in BFS
Most of my carrier is dealing with data particularly BFS domain. During my days, I always curiostics know how/why/when this data will have huge impact to business than normal reporting/visualisation.
And past 4 years I'm learning and hearing about data science/data scientist role and its significant impact to business particularly retail and healthcare domain. Then I decided myself to align with data science. As I am enthusiastic and curiostic person definitely able to bring huge impact to BFS business. 
I'm looking forward to learn more in AI/ML, phython, stats and maths. Hope this journey in data science going to be more impact to my carrier in 2020.


Based on the videos and the reading material, how would you define a data scientist and data science? 
As per this course videos and reading material, I found new way of describing Data scientist which I never heard anywhere before.
Main characteristic of data scientist would be as per this course,
1. Enthusiastic/Curiostic person
2. Good story teller
3. Some what good in technology specially programming language
4. known skill in math and stats

More generally, a data scientist is someone who knows how to extract meaning from and interpret data, which requires both tools and methods from statistics and machine learning, as well as being human. 
A data scientist's role combines computer science, statistics, and mathematics. They analyze, process, and model data then interpret the results to create actionable plans for companies and other organizations. Data scientists help improve how humans make decisions and how algorithms optimize outcomes” I believe that data science has the power to improve the human condition by helping us investigate phenomena, acquire new knowledge and integrate previous knowledge with new ideas

As discussed in the videos and the reading material, data science can be applied to problems across different industries. What industry are you passionate about and would like to pursue a data science career in? 
I would like to pursue my data science carrier in Banking and Finance. The reason behind this is I have my domain experience mostly in BFS. And I always deal with data analytics in BFS data. As I have fare knowledge in BFS, I could say we can use data science in BFS as below,
Bank industry use data science in the areas of customer service, fraud detection, forecasting, understanding consumer sentiment, customer profiling and target marketing, among others. Banks are using unstructured data from social media to assess how customers view the brand and if they are happy with their brand offerings.
Finance industry use of Data Science is mostly in the field of Risk Management and analysis. Companies also use Data Science customer portfolio management for analyzing trends in data through business intelligence tools. Financial companies use data science for fraud detection to find anomalous transactions and insurance scams.

Based on the videos and the reading material, what are the eight main components of a report that would be delivered at the end of a data science project?
